CALLED<br />
CRIMSON</big></h1>

<h2>By<br />
DARIUS JOHN GRANGER</h2></div>

<p><i>When the starship</i> Star of
Fire <i>collided with a meteor
swarm six parsecs stellar
north of the galactic hub in
the year A.D. 2278, it lost its
atmosphere within forty-five
minutes. At first it was
thought that every man,
woman and child of the four
thousand, one hundred and
sixty-six aboard were lost, in
this the greatest of all interstellar
disasters. But as was
discovered twenty years later
in the Purcell exploration,
this was not quite the case.

<b><small>The Cyclops&mdash;not hungry at the moment&mdash;regarded Robin as a new toy.</small></b></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">It was</span> the nasty little boy
from B Deck who had
stolen her doll. She hated
him. He was horrid. She slipped
out of their stateroom
while her Mom and Dad were
dressing for dinner. She'd
find that horrid little boy on
B Deck. She'd scratch his
eyes out.</p>

<p>Her name was Robin Sinclair
and she was five years
old and mad enough to throw
the boy from B Deck out into
space, only she didn't know
how to go about that.</p>

<p>She went down the companionway
to B Deck, where
the people dressed differently.
The colors weren't as bright,
somehow, the cloth not so
fine. It was a major distinction
in the eyes of a five-year-old
girl, especially one who
loved to run her fingers over
fine synthetics and who even
had a favorite color. Her favorite
color was crimson.</p>

<p>"'Scuse me, mister. Didja
see a little boy with a doll
with a crimson dress on?"</p>

<p>A smile. But she was deadly
serious. "Not me, young
lady."</p>

<p>She walked for a while
aimlessly on B Deck. She saw
two little boys, but they weren't
the right ones. Pouting
now, almost in tears, she was
on the verge of giving up.
Mom and Dad could buy her
a new doll. Mom and Dad
were richer than anybody,
weren't they?</p>

<p>Then, all of a sudden, she
saw him. He was just ducking
out of sight up ahead.
Under his arm was tucked
the doll with the crimson
dress, her favorite doll.</p>

<p>"Hey!" she cried. "Hey,
wait for me!"</p>

<p>Her little feet pounding,
she raced down the companionway.
As she reached the
irising door in the bulkhead,
an electric eye opened it for
her. She had never come this
way before. It was not as
bright and clean as the rest
of the ship. She had not even
seen the sign which said
PASSENGERS NOT PERMITTED
BEYOND THIS
POINT. But then, she could
barely read, anyway.</p>

<p>She caught a quick second
glimpse of the boy, and started
running as he rounded a
turn in the corridor. Shouting
for him to stop, she reached
the turn and saw him up
ahead. He looked back at her
and stuck out his tongue and
kept running.</p>

<hr />

<p>It was then that the whole
world shuddered, like it was
trying to shake itself to
pieces.</p>

<p>Alarm bells clanged everywhere.
Whistles shrilled.
Pretty soon uniformed men
were running in all directions.
Robin Sinclair was suddenly
very frightened. She
wanted to go back to A Deck,
to her Mom and Dad, but she
had followed the boy through
so many twisting, turning
corridors that she knew she
would be lost if she tried. She
looked ahead. The boy seemed
confident as he made his way.
She followed him. But she
was really mad at him now. It
was his fault she was so far
from Mom and Dad when a
thing like this happened.</p>

<hr />

<p>Uniformed members of the
crew continued rushing by.
She heard snatches of conversation
she didn't understand.</p>

<p>"Trying to patch it ..."</p>

<p>"The whole stern section of
the ship. Losing air fast ..."</p>

<p>"The lifeboats. I was just
down there. Every last one
of 'em. Gone. The meteor took
'em right off into space."</p>

<p>"If the damage can't be repaired ..."</p>

<p>And one man, finally, with
a face awful to behold:
"Patches won't hold. We're
losing air faster'n it can be
replaced. Better tell the Captain."</p>

<p>A man in a lot of gold
braid rushed into view. He
was distinguished-looking,
but old. Boy, he was old,
Robin thought. He looked as
old as her grandfather.</p>

<p>"Captain! We're losing too
much air. It can't be replaced."</p>

<p>"Then prepare to abandon
ship."</p>

<p>"But, sir, every lifeboat is
gone!"</p>

<p>"No lifeboats? No lifeboats!"</p>

<p>The boy stuck his tongue
out again. She ran after him,
shaking her little fist. They
were completely absorbed in
their private enmity while the
word went out that the situation
was hopeless and almost
five thousand people prepared
to die.</p>

<p>"I've got you now!"</p>

<p>He had run up against a
blank wall. She came toward
him, holding her hands out
for the doll with the crimson
dress. He held it behind his
back. She reached around to
get it but he pushed her and
she fell down.</p>

<p>"I'll fix you!" she threatened,
getting up and rushing toward
him again. Big arms
came down, and big hands
grabbed her.</p>

<p>"There now, little miss," a
voice said. "Why aren't you
with your folks? Time like
this, you ought to be with
your folks. What is it, B
Deck?"</p>

<p>"A Deck," Robin said
haughtily. "<i>He's</i> from B. Why
is everybody running around
so?"</p>

<p>He was a tall, slat-thin man
with a kind-looking face.
"Say, wait a minute!" he suddenly
said, looking perplexed.
"They all the time said I was
nuts, building that damn
thing. Well, I can't fit into it,
but maybe these here kids
can."</p>

<p>He scooped Robin up with
one hand, got the boy with
the other. "I want my doll!"
Robin cried, but the boy held
it away from her.</p>

<p>"Take it easy now," the
man said. "Take it easy.
We'll take care of you."</p>

<hr />

<p>He ran with them to one of
the repair bays of the great,
doom-bound starship. In one
corner, beyond the now useless
patching equipment, was
a table. On the table stood a
model of the <i>Star of Fire</i>. It
was six feet long and perfect
in every external detail. He
hadn't got around to the inside
yet. The inside was completely
empty. It had rockets
and everything. There was no
reason why it wouldn't be
perfectly space-worthy. Why,
it would even hold an atmosphere ...</p>

<p>"In you go!" he said.</p>

<p>The little boy was suddenly
scared. "I want my Mother,"
he said. "I want my Dad."</p>

<p>"In you go."</p>

<p>Robin felt herself lifted,
and thrust inside something.
It was dark in there. She
moved around and bumped
into something. She moved
around some more and bumped
against the little boy from
B Deck.</p>

<p>"How do you get out of
here?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know," he said.</p>

<p>"I want my doll back," she
said.</p>

<p>"Oh yeah?"</p>

<p>"You better give it to me."</p>

<p>He said nothing. There was
a hissing sound, and a faint
roar. Far away, something
slid ponderously.</p>

<p>"Pleasant voyage, little
ones!" a voice boomed.</p>

<p>Something sat on her chest
all at once, squeezing all the
air from her. It was a great
weight holding her motionless,
squeezing. She wanted to
cry, but couldn't get the
sound out. She wanted her
Mom. Mom would know what
to do.</p>

<p>She was crushed and flattened
into a tunnel of blackness.</p>

<p>Thirty minutes later, the
starship <i>Star of Fire</i>, outworld-bound
from Sol to the
starswarms beyond Ophiuchus,
lost all its remaining
air. It became an enormous
coffin spinning end over end
in space amid the blaze of
starlight near the center of
the galaxy.</p>

<p>One tiny spaceship, a small
model of the huge liner, sped
away. If it went two days
finding no planet, its two occupants
would perish when
the small oxygen supply gave
out. If it found a planet it
would circle and land automatically.
The possibility of
this was small, but not remote.
For here at the center
of the galaxy, stellar distances
are more nearly planetary
and most of the stars
have attendant planets. But
even then, it would have to be
a world capable of supporting
their lives ...</p>

<p>They sped on, in all innocence.
She was five. He was
six. His name was Charlie
Fullerton. He had her doll.
She hated him.</p>

<hr />

<p>Two hours after the tiny
model spaceship landed on a
planet with three suns in the
sky, Robin Sinclair awoke.
She felt cramped and uncomfortable.
It took her a while
to orient herself. She had
some kind of a dream. A
dream was a funny thing.
Mom said it wasn't real. But
it sure was real to her.</p>

<p>She got up and pushed with
her hands. A section of the
tiny spaceship sprang away
at her touch, admitting blinding
light. She lay there with
her eyes tightly shut, but
after a while she could see.
The boy was sleeping. She
still hated him. He was sleeping
with her doll in his arms.
She took the doll and he
moved his arms and woke up.
She jumped out of the open
spaceship with the doll and
started running.</p>

<p>She ran along a beach. But
the sand was green. The
ocean hissed and roared and
there was nobody else. "N'ya!
N'ya! Y'can't catch me!" she
bawled at the top of her voice.
And fell down in the sand.</p>

<p>He caught up with her and
fell on top of her and they
wrestled for the doll. The
surf thundered nearby. The
tide, capricious in the grip of
the three suns, rose suddenly,
flooding them with chill
water. Coughing and spluttering
and choking, they retreated
further up the beach.</p>

<p>Soon they quieted down.</p>

<p>"I'm soaking wet," she
said.</p>

<p>"My name is Charlie," he
said sullenly. "Let's go back
now."</p>

<p>"How do we go back?" she
wanted to know.</p>

<p>"That's a nice doll," Charlie
said.</p>

<p>"You took it from me!" Accusingly.</p>

<p>"Aw, I only wanted to look
at it."</p>

<p>"She has a crimson dress
and everything."</p>

<p>"This is some world,"
Charlie said after a while.</p>

<p>"What's a world?"</p>

<p>"Oh, a world is&mdash;you know&mdash;everything."</p>

<p>"Oh."</p>

<p>"You think it has Indians?"</p>

<p>She said, "It ought to have
Indians, anyhow."</p>

<p>"And pirates too?" he asked
in a voice full of awe.</p>

<p>She nodded her head very
seriously. "I like pirates," she
said. "They're so scarey."</p>

<p>Just then a ship came into
view far away across the
water. It had enormous sails
and a black hull. On the fore-sail
was painted a huge black
skull.</p>

<p>"Let's get out of here!"
Charlie cried in alarm. But
beetling cliffs reared behind
the beach and although they
ran frantically along at the
edge of the green sand, they
could find no way to scale the
cliffs. The pirate ship came
closer and closer.</p>

<p>They got down whimpering
at the base of the cliffs
and remained very still. After
a long time the pirate ship
came close to shore. A longboat
was dispatched and its
oars flashed in the triple sunlight
like giant legs on which
the longboat walked across
the waves toward the beach.</p>

<p>Then the pirates were
ashore. The man who led
them had only one leg, and a
peg. He looked very mean.</p>

<hr />

<p>"It's Blackbeard the Pirate!"
said Charlie in a
frightened whisper. His Dad
had once read him a story
about Blackbeard.</p>

<p>The pirate with the wooden
leg suddenly had a black
beard.</p>

<p>"The doll!" cried Robin.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"We left her down there.
Crimson." She called her doll
Crimson because she had a
crimson dress.</p>

<p>Now Blackbeard approached
the model spaceship with
his crew. They gathered
around it, frowning. Robin
watched, her face pale, her
eyes wide. Crimson was there
on the sand. They were going
to see Crimson. Even as she
was thinking these horrible
thoughts, one of the pirates
saw Crimson and picked her
up. Blackbeard came over and
took the doll and looked at
her. At that moment there
was a shout from above the
cliffs and an arrow suddenly
transfixed one of the pirates.
He fell down writhing and
Blackbeard and the rest of
his men raced back to the
longboat.</p>

<p>"Indians," Charlie whispered
knowingly.</p>

<p>The Indians shouted and
yelled.</p>

<p>"Are there any cowboys
here?" Robin asked hopefully.</p>

<p>"No, sir. No cowboys,"
Charlie said very definitely.</p>

<p>"I'm hungry," Robin said.
"I wish we had something."</p>

<p>With a little squeal of delight,
she looked down at her
feet. Two platters of fried
chicken, with all the trimmings.
Her favorite. They ate
ravenously, not hearing the
Indians any more. They
watched the longboat return
to the pirate ship. All this
way, they could see little
Crimson's dress as Blackbeard
took her aboard. Robin
finished her fried chicken and
started to cry.</p>

<p>"Girls," said Charlie in disgust.</p>

<p>"I can't help it. Poor Crimson."</p>

<p>"Is she dead?"</p>

<p>"Blackbeard the pirate took
her."</p>

<p>"Charles was my grandfather's
name. My grandfather
died and they named
me Charles."</p>

<p>"I want Crimson!"</p>

<p>"Get down! The Indians
will see you."</p>

<p>"The Indians went away. I
want Crimson!"</p>

<p>"We could name this beach
after Crimson."</p>

<p>"Aw, what do you know?
It's only a beach."</p>

<p>"We could name the whole
wide world." Charlie gestured
expansively.</p>

<p>The green sand of the
beach became crimson. The
sky had a crimson glow.</p>

<p>"It sure is a funny world,"
Charlie said. Laughter loud
as thunder echoed in the sky.
"A world called Crimson," he
added.</p>

<hr />

<p>The tide came in. Spray
and surf bounded off the
rocks, wetting them. "We better
go up the hill," Robin said.
By hill she meant the perpendicular
cliffs behind them.</p>

<p>The tide thundered in.
They were sodden. They
clung to the rocks.</p>

<p>"We need an elevator or
something," Charlie said.</p>

<p>Golden cables flashed in the
sunlight. The gilt elevator
cage came down. They climbed
in as a big wave came and
battered the rocks. The elevator
went up, up to the top
of the cliff. They could see a
long way across the water.
They could watch the pirate
ship sailing away, the skull
black as night on its sail.</p>

<p>They got out of the elevator
at the top of the cliff. They
didn't see any Indians, but
they saw the ashes of a campfire.</p>

<p>"Are there lions and tigers
and everything?" Robin asked
in wonder, gazing out over
the beach and the sea and
then turning around to see
the green forest which began
fifty yards beyond the edge of
the cliff.</p>

<p>"Sure there are lions and
tigers," Charlie said matter-of-factly.</p>

<hr />

<p>Off somewhere in the
woods, a big cat roared.
Robin whimpered.</p>

<p>"I w-was only fooling,"
Charlie said, vaguely understanding
that you could somehow
make things happen on
this world called Crimson.</p>

<p>But he learned a lesson
that night. You could make
things happen on Crimson,
but you couldn't unmake
them.</p>

<p>The tiger roared again. But
they were downwind from it
and it went elsewhere in
search of prey. Huddled together
near the embers of the
Indian campfire, the two children
slept fitfully through the
cold night.</p>

<p>Then the three suns finally
came up on three different
sides of the horizon. Crimson
was deadly, but beautiful....</p>

<hr />

<p><i>Although credit for the discovery
of</i> Aladdin's Planet
<i>goes to the explorer Richard
Purcell of Earth, two Earth
children actually were shipwrecked
there twenty years
before Purcell's expedition.
But instead of paving the way
for Purcell, they actually
made the exploration more
difficult for him. In fact, it
was positively fraught with
peril. But since</i> Aladdin's
Planet <i>had become the galaxy's
arsenal of plenty, it was
well worth Purcell's effort. As
any schoolboy knows in this
utopia of 24th century plenty,</i>
Aladdin's Planet, <i>almost exactly
at the heart of the galaxy,
where matter is spontaneously
created to sweep out
in long cosmic trails across
the galaxy, is the home not
merely of spontaneous creation
of matter, but spontaneous</i>
formed <i>creation, with any
human psyche capable of doing
the handwork of God. A
planet of great import ...</i></p>

<p class="rgt"><i>&mdash;from The ANNALS OF SPACE, Vol. 2</i></p>

<hr />

<p>She stood poised for a glorious
moment on the very
edge of the rock, the bronze
and pink of her glistening in
the sun, the spray still clinging
to her from her last dive.
Then, grace in every line of
her lithe body, she sprang
from the rock in a perfectly
executed swan dive.</p>

<p>Charlie helped her out,
smiling. "That was pretty,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Well, you taught me how."
Her figure was not yet that of
a woman, but far more than
that of a girl. She was very
beautiful and Charlie knew
this although he had no standards
to judge by, except for
the Indian women they occasionally
saw or Blackbeard's
slave girls when the pirate
ship came in to trade.</p>

<p>Unselfconsciously, Robin
climbed into her gold-mesh
shorts. Charlie helped her
fasten the gold-mesh halter.
Long, long ago&mdash;it seemed an
unreal dream, almost&mdash;he had
been a very small boy and his
mother had taken him to a
show in which everyone
danced and sang and wore
gold-mesh clothing. He had
never forgotten it, and now
all their clothing was gold-mesh.</p>

<hr />

<p>Robin spun around and
looked at him. Her tawny
blonde hair fell almost to her
waist, and he helped her comb
it with a jewel-encrusted
comb he had wished into being
a few days before.</p>

<p>"I so like Crimson!" she
cried impulsively.</p>

<p>Charlie smiled. "Why,
that's a funny thing to say. Is
there any other kind of a
place?"</p>

<p>"You mean, but Crimson?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I don't know. It is funny.
Sometimes I think&mdash;"</p>

<p>Charlie smiled at her, a
little condescendingly. "Oh,
it's the book again, is it?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"All right. It's the book.
Stop making fun of me."</p>

<p>Many years ago, when
they'd been small children,
they had returned to the ruined
spaceship which had
brought them to Crimson. It
had been empty except for
the book, as if the book had
been placed there for them by
whatever power had put them
in the spaceship. Naturally,
they had not been able to
read, but they kept the book
anyway. Then one day, years
later, Robin had wished to be
able to read and the next time
she lifted the book and opened
it, the magic of the words
was miraculously revealed to
her. The book was called A
ONE VOLUME ENCYCLOPEDIC
HISTORY and it told
about just everything&mdash;except
Crimson. There was no
mention of Crimson at all.
Robin read the book over and
over again until she almost
knew it by heart. Even
Charlie had listened to it
twice all the way through
when she read it, but he had
never wished for the ability
to read himself.</p>

<p>Now Charlie asked: "Do
you really believe the book?
This is Crimson. This is
real."</p>

<p>"I don't know. Sometimes
I think this isn't as real as
everything in the book. And
sometimes I just don't know."</p>

<p>They walked in silence to
their elevator and took it to
the top of the highest cliff.
They had wished for a house
there, like one Robin had seen
in the book. They had wished
for many things to make
their lives interesting, or
pleasant. They had peopled
Crimson with the fruit of
their wishes, using the ONE
VOLUME ENCYCLOPEDIC
HISTORY as a guide.</p>

<hr />

<p>They lived a mile from the
Indian Camp. They traded
with the Indians who,
strangely, did not know how
to wish for things. Neither
did the pirates, or anyone.
Just Robin and Charlie. The
pirates lived across the sea on
an island. To the south along
the shore were Phoenicians,
Greeks, Mayas, Royal Navymen,
Submariners, mermaids
and Cyclopes. To the north
along the shore were Polynesians,
Maoris, Panamanians
and Dutchmen. Inland were
Cannibals, Lotus Eaters, a
few settlements of cowboys to
make life interesting for the
Indians, farmers, Russians,
Congressmen and Ministers.
All had been created by Robin
and Charlie, who visited them
sometimes. They never believed
for a minute that
Robin and Charlie had really
created them, although all
were amazed by Robin and
Charlie's ability to make
things appear out of thin air.</p>

<p>Just as they reached their
house, an Indian brave came
running down the trail toward
them.</p>

<p>"Skyship come!" he cried,
gesturing wildly and excitedly.</p>

<p>"Skyship?" repeated Charlie,
looking at Robin. "Have
you created any spaceships?"</p>

<p>"No. You know it's a bargain
between us. We don't
create anything we don't
think we understand."</p>

<p>The Indian was sweating.
His name was Tashtu, which
meant Wild Eagle, and he
was their go-between with
the tribe. "Skyship sweep
across heavens," he said.
"Not land. Go up in Wild
Country."</p>

<p>Charlie's interest quickened.
Wild Country. They had
created it on impulse, about
twenty miles from the Indian
Camp, midway between the
settlements of Congressmen
inland and Cyclopes on the
shore. It was a place of tortuous
gorges and rocks and
mountains, utterly lifeless.
No one ever went there.
Someday, he had always told
Robin, they would explore
Wild Country. If there really
was a spaceship, and if it had
gone there ...</p>

<p>"No," Robin said. "I know
what you're thinking. But I'm
perfectly happy here."</p>

<p>"You just now said you
sometimes thought Crimson
wasn't real and there were
other, real worlds which&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's different. I can
dream, can't I?"</p>

<p>"But don't you see, if a
spaceship's really come, maybe
they can tell us."</p>

<hr />

<p>She gripped his arm.
"Charlie. Oh, Charlie, I don't
know. I'm afraid. We've been
happy here, haven't we? We
really wouldn't want it to
change ..."</p>

<p>"I'm going to Wild Country,"
Charlie said stubbornly.</p>

<p>Tashtu nodded his head. "It is
good that you do. For the
braves&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't tell me they went
after the skyship?" Charlie
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, Lord. Skyship come
low, ruin crops mile around.
War dance follow. War party
leave last sunrise."</p>

<p>"Six hours ago!" Charlie
cried. "Can we overtake
them?"</p>

<p>Tashtu shrugged. "Hurry,
Lord."</p>

<p>"Don't you see," Charlie
told Robin. "They're savages.
They wouldn't understand
anything like spaceships.
They wouldn't want to. If
they get the chance, they'll
kill first and ask questions
afterwards. We've got to go
to the Wild Country now."</p>

<p>Big and brawny Tashtu
was nodding his head earnestly,
but Robin seemed unconvinced.
"Why," she said,
"there isn't even anything
about Wild Country in the
book."</p>

<p>"That's because we made
it."</p>

<p>"And besides, the Congressmen
are dangerous."</p>

<p>"Congressmen? Don't you
mean the Cyclopes?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm sorry. The Cyclopes
are dangerous."</p>

<p>She couldn't possibly have
meant the Congressmen. It
was never clear to either of
them precisely what a Congressman
did. But there were
hundreds of them on one side
of Wild Country and they
were forever making speeches
and promises, little round
bald men with great, rich
voices and wonderful vocabularies.
Charlie loved to hear
them speak.</p>

<p>"We go, Lord?" Tashtu
asked.</p>

<p>Charlie nodded and went
inside swiftly for his rifle. It
was modeled after the most
powerful rifle in the encyclopedia
and was called a Mannlicher
Elephant Gun. Robin
came with her own smaller
Springfield repeater.</p>

<p>"Ready?" Charlie asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. We can think up food
along the trail."</p>

<p>"Hurry, Lord," Tashtu
urged.</p>

<p>Charlie could hardly contain
his excitement. The Wild
Country, at last. And a spaceship.</p>

<hr />

<p>By the time they were
ready to make planetfall on
the unexplored world, Purcell
knew his dislike of Glaudot
bordered on actual hatred.
Purcell, who was forty-five
years old and a bachelor, liked
his spacemen tough, yes: you
had to be tough to land on,
explore, and subdue a couple
of dozen worlds, as Purcell
himself had done. But he also
liked his spacemen with humility:
facing the unknown
and sometimes the unknowable
at every step of the way,
you needed humility.</p>

<p>Glaudot, younger than Purcell
by fifteen years, confident,
arrogant, a lean hard
man and handsome in a
gaunt-cheeked, saturnine way,
lacked humility. For one
thing, he treated the crew like
dirt and had treated them
that way since blastoff from
Earth almost five months before.
For another, he seemed
impatient with Purcell's orders,
although Purcell was
not a cautious man, and certainly
not a timid one. What
had been growing between
them flared out into the open
moments before planetfall.</p>

<p>"I can't get over it," Purcell
said. "I've never seen a
world anything like it." They
had made telescopic observations
from within the atmosphere.
"Giants living in
caves," Purcell went on.
"Sailing ships flying the Jolly
Roger. A town consisting of
miniature replicas of the
White House on Earth. Mermaids."</p>

<p>"Don't tell me you really
thought you saw mermaids?"
Glaudot asked a little condescendingly.</p>

<p>"All right, I'll admit I only
caught a glimpse of them. I
thought they were mermaids.
But what about the Indians?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Glaudot admitted.
"I saw the Indians."</p>

<p>Using their atmospheric
rockets, they had flown over
the Indian village at an altitude
of only a few hundred
feet, to see bronze-skinned
men rush out of tents and
stare up at them in awe.
After that, Purcell had decided
to find some desolate
spot in which to land, in order
not to risk a too-sudden
encounter with any of the
fantastically diversified natives.</p>

<p>Now Glaudot said: "You're
taking what we saw too literally,
Captain. Why, I remember
on Harfonte we had all
sorts of hallucinations until
Captain Jamison discovered
they were exactly that&mdash;we'd
been hypnotized into seeing
the things we most feared by
powerless natives who really
feared us."</p>

<p>"This isn't Harfonte," Purcell
said, a little irritably.</p>

<p>"Yeah, but you weren't
there."</p>

<p>"I know that, Glaudot. I'm
only trying to point out that
each world must be considered
as unique. Each world presents
its own problems,
which&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I say this is like Harfonte
all over again. I say if you'd
had the guts to land right
smack in the middle of that
Indian village, you'd have
seen for yourself. I say to
play it close to the vest is
ridiculous," Glaudot said, and
then smiled deprecatingly.
"Begging your pardon, of
course, Captain. But don't
you see, man, you've got to
show the extraterrestrials,
whatever form they take, that
Earthmen aren't afraid of
them."</p>

<p>"Caution and fear aren't
the same thing," Purcell insisted.
He didn't know why
he bothered to explain this to
Glaudot. Perhaps it was because
Ensign Chandler,
youngest man in the exploration
party, was in the lounge
listening to them. Chandler
was a nice kid, clean-cut and
right out of the finest tradition
of Earth, but Chandler
was, like all boys barely out
of their teens, impressionable.
He was particularly impressionable
in these, his first
months in space.</p>

<p>"When you're cautious it's
as much to protect the natives
as yourself," Purcell went on,
and then put into simple
words what Glaudot and
Chandler should have learned
at the Academy for Exploration,
anyway.</p>

<p>When he finished, Glaudot
shrugged and asked: "What
do you think, Ensign Chandler?"</p>

<p>Chandler blushed slowly.
"I&mdash;I'd rather not say," he
told them. "Captain Purcell
is&mdash;the captain."</p>

<p>Glaudot smiled his triumph
at Purcell. It was then, for
the first time, that Purcell's
dislike for the man became
intense. Purcell wondered
how long he'd been poisoning
the youth's mind against the
doctrines of the Academy.</p>

<p>Just then a light glowed in
the bulkhead and a metallic
voice intoned: "Prepare for
landing. Prepare for landing
at once."</p>

<p>Purcell, striding to his
blast-hammock, told Glaudot,
who was the expedition's
exec, "I'll want the landing
party ready to move half an
hour after planetfall."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Glaudot
eagerly. At least there was
something they agreed on.</p>

<hr />

<p>"Men," Purcell told the
small landing party as they
assembled near the main airlock
thirty-five minutes later,
"we have an obligation to our
civilization which I hope all
of you understand. While
here on this unknown world
we must do nothing to bring
discredit to the name of
Earth and the galactic culture
which Earth represents."</p>

<p>They had all seen the bleak
moon-like landscape through
the viewports. They were
eager to get out there and
plant the flag of Earth and
determine what the new
world was like. There were
only eight of them in the first
landing party: others would
follow once the eight established
a preliminary base of
operations. The eight were
wearing the new-style, light-weight
spacesuits which all
exploration parties used even
though the temperature and
atmosphere of the new world
seemed close enough to
Earth-norm. It had long ago been
decided at the Academy that
chances couldn't be taken
with some unknown factor,
possibly toxic, fatal and irreversible,
in an unknown atmosphere.
After a day or two
of thorough laboratory analysis
of the air they'd be able
to chuck their spacesuits if
all went well.</p>

<p>They filed through the airlock
silently, Purcell first with
the flag of Earth, then Glaudot,
then the others. White
faces watched from the viewport
as they clomped across
the convoluted terrain.</p>

<p>"Nobody here but us chickens!"
Glaudot said, and he
laughed, after they had walked
some way across the desolate
landscape. "But then,
what did you expect? Captain
took us clear of all the more
promising places."</p>

<p>The man's only motive,
Purcell decided, was his colossal
ego. He made no reply:
that would be descending to
Glaudot's level.</p>

<p>After they walked almost
entirely across the low-walled
crater in which the exploration
ship had come down, and
after Purcell had planted the
flag on the highest pinnacle
within the low crater walls,
Glaudot said:</p>

<p>"How's about taking a
look-see over the top, Captain?
At least that much."</p>

<p>Purcell wasn't in favor of
the idea. It would mean leaving
sight of the ship too soon.
But the radio voices of most
of the men indicated that they
agreed with Glaudot, so Purcell
shrugged and said a pair
of volunteers could go, if they
promised to rejoin the main
party within two hours.</p>

<p>Glaudot immediately volunteered.
That at least made
sense. Glaudot had the courage
of his convictions. Several
others volunteered, but
the first hand up had been
Ensign Chandler's.</p>

<p>"I don't want to sound like
a martinet," Purcell told
them. "But you understand
that by two hours I mean two
hours. Not a minute more."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Chandler said.</p>

<p>"Glaudot?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," the Executive
Officer replied.</p>

<p>"All right," Purcell said.
He walked over to the first of
the big magna-sleds piled
high with equipment. "We'll
be setting up the base camp
over here. I know the men
still in the ship will want to
stretch their legs soon as possible.
We don't want to have
to go looking for you, Glaudot."</p>

<p>"Not me, Captain," Glaudot
assured him, and walked
off toward the crater rim
with young Ensign Chandler.</p>

<hr />

<p>"What the devil was that?"
Chandler said forty-five minutes
later.</p>

<p>"Stop jumping at every
shadow you see. Relax."</p>

<p>"I thought I saw something
moving behind that rock."</p>

<p>"So, go take a look."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hell, boy, don't let that
Purcell put the fear of the
unknown into you on your
very first trip out. Huh, what
do you say?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, Mr. Glaudot,"
Ensign Chandler replied.</p>

<p>"After all," Glaudot went
on, "we have nothing to be
afraid of. We're still within
sight of the ship."</p>

<p>Chandler turned around. "I
don't see it," he said.</p>

<p>"From the top of that rock
you could."</p>

<p>"Think so?"</p>

<p>"Sure I do. Why don't you
take a look if it will make you
feel better?"</p>

<p>"All right," Chandler said,
and smiled at his own temerity.
But he knew vaguely that
he'd been caught in a crossfire
between the cautious Purcell
and the bold, arrogant
Glaudot. Sometimes he really
thought that the Captain's
caution made sense: on Wulcreston,
he'd learned at the
Academy, a whole Earth expedition
had been slaughtered
before contact because the
natives mistook hand telescopes
for weapons. And
surely on any world a spacesuited
man looked more like a
monster than a man although
he was vulnerable in a spacesuit,
even more vulnerable
than a naked man because he
could only run awkwardly.</p>

<p>All this Chandler thought
as he climbed the high rock
rampart. He'd send a subspace
letter back to the folks
tonight, sure enough, he told
himself. Not only had he been
chosen for the preliminary
exploration party, he'd made
the first trip out of sight of
the spaceship. It certainly
was something to write home
about, and Mom would be
very proud ...</p>

<p>He was on top of the rock
now. The vast tortuous landscape
spread out below him
like a relief map in a mapmaker's
nightmare. Far to
his left, beyond Glaudot's
spacesuited figure, he could
see the projectile-shaped
spaceship resting on its tail
fins. And to his right&mdash;</p>

<p>He stared. He gawked.</p>

<p>At the last moment he tried
to get down from the rock,
but his spaceboot caught on
an outcropping and his fatal
mistake was standing upright
in an attempt to free it.</p>

<p>Then all at once in a blinding
burst of pain he was
clutching at something in his
chest but knew as his life
ebbed rapidly from his young
body that it would not matter
if he was able to pull the
cruel shaft out....</p>

<hr />

<p>Glaudot went rushing up
the side of the rock. He still
couldn't believe his eyes. Ensign
Chandler had been impaled
by two long feathered
shafts, two arrows. The force
of the first one had spun
Chandler around and he lay
now with his back arched
across the topmost ramparts
of the rock, two arrows protruding
from his chest and
his life blood, starkly crimson
against the white of the
spacesuit, pouring out.</p>

<p>Reaching the top of the
rock in an attempt to drag
the dying boy down, Glaudot
saw the Indians rushing up
the other side of the crater
wall. Indians, he thought incredulously.
Indians, as in the
American West hundreds of
years ago. Indians ... But
just what the hell were they
doing here?</p>

<p>A muscular brave notched
an arrow, his right hand
drawing the feathered shaft
back to his ear. Quickly Glaudot
flung his arms skyward,
hoping that the universal gesture
of surrender would be
understood. The brave stood
statue-still. His lips opened.
He was speaking to another
of the half-dozen Indians in
the raiding band, but Glaudot
could not hear the words
through his space helmet. He
knew his life hung in the balance.</p>

<p>He watched, fascinated and
helpless, as the Indian who
had slain Ensign Chandler
came toward him.</p>

<hr />

<p>Tashtu said: "Two raiding
bands, Lord. One go north.
Other south. We follow?"</p>

<p>They had reached the advance
Indian camp on the
fringe of the Wild Country.
So far they had seen nothing
of the Cyclopes who lived in
this part of the world. Of all
their creations, Charlie and
Robin feared and avoided
only the Cyclopes, the enormous
one-eyed giants which
had so intrigued Robin in the
encyclopedia that she'd had a
compulsion to create them,
and had done so.</p>

<p>"We can't follow both
bands," Charlie said, looking
troubled.</p>

<p>"Why can't we?" Robin
asked. "You go north with
some of the braves, Charlie.
I'll go south. We ought to be
able to overtake the raiding
parties before anything happens."</p>

<p>"I can't let you go alone."</p>

<p>"All right. I'll take Tashtu
with me. Don't you think
Tashtu can take care of me as
well as you can?"</p>

<p>"Well, I just don't like the
idea&mdash;" Charlie began.</p>

<p>"That's silly. If we have to
find them before there's trouble,
we have to find them.
Well, don't we?"</p>

<p>Charlie gave her an uncertain
nod. He had grown up
with her and had seen her
every day of his life, but
every time he took a good
look at her, at the lovely face
and the tawny, long-limbed
form ill-concealed by the gold-mesh
garments, it took his
breath away. Although in a
sense a whole world was his
plaything, he had never seen
anything so lovely. Finally he
said, "I guess you're too logical
for me. Take care of her,
Tashtu."</p>

<p>"With my life, Lord," the
Indian vowed as the group
broke up. Robin ran to Charlie
and hugged him, kissing
his cheek half playfully, half
in earnest.</p>

<p>"You be careful, too," she
said, and went off with Tashtu
and several of the braves.</p>

<hr />

<p>Naturally she was excited.
She knew more about spacemen
than Charlie did. She
had read the encyclopedia
more carefully, hadn't she?
She wondered what the spacemen
would be like. She couldn't
help wondering it because
the only man she had ever
known, except for those they
had created, was Charlie. Of
course, she hadn't told Charlie
this in so many words, but
she felt, had always felt,
vaguely and now felt clearly,
that before she could settle
down contentedly with Charlie,
she would have to know
something of the world beyond
Crimson. And there was
a vast world&mdash;a multitude of
worlds&mdash;beyond Crimson. She
knew that. The encyclopedia
mentioned all of them but did
not mention Crimson at all.</p>

<p>They walked for several
minutes through green forest,
and then abruptly came to the
edge of the Wild Country.
Even the idea of the Wild
Country brought an eagerness
to Robin's limbs and
made her walk more rapidly.
The Wild Country was unknown,
wasn't it? They had
created it without knowing
quite what they were creating,
and had never explored
it.</p>

<p>She went ahead with Tashtu
over the rocks and crushed
pumice. No winds blew in
Wild Country. The air was
neither hot nor cold. The
landscape seemed changeless
and eternal, as if it had been
that way since before the
dawn of history, although actually
Charlie and Robin had
created it only a few years
before.</p>

<p>They forged on for two
hours, Tashtu following the
easily read spoor in the pumice.
They came at last to a low
crater wall, where the spoor
disappeared. At first Tashtu
was confused, but then he
pointed to the top, several
hundred feet above their
heads. Robin caught a glimpse
of tawny skin and feathers
and buckskin in the sunlight.</p>

<p>"Haloo!" Tashtu called,
and some of the braves above
them whirled, all speaking excitedly
in the clumsy English
which was the only tongue
they knew.</p>

<p>"Huragpha slay monster,"
they said. "Capture other
monster. But then see ..."
the words drifted off into silence.
Obviously, the Indians
were perplexed. "You come,
see. Monster, him bleed like
man."</p>

<p>At Tashtu's side, Robin
rushed up the steep rocky
slope. When they reached the
top, breathless and all but exhausted,
Robin put her hand
to her mouth with a little cry
of horror.</p>

<hr />

<p>There was a dead man
stretched out on the rock
there, two arrows transfixing
his chest through the fabric
of his spacesuit. The spacesuit
had probably frightened
the Indians, but he was a man
all right. Had they been closer,
even the Indians would have
known that. That poor man....
Why, he was hardly more
than a boy.</p>

<p>Spacemen!</p>

<p>And there was another,
surrounded now by several of
the Indians. "Him prisoner,"
said the Indian called Huragpha
a little uncertainly.</p>

<p>Robin walked over to the
man in the spacesuit. He was
a big man, even bigger than
Charlie. He looked very
strong, but the spacesuit
might have been deceptive.
He looked frightened, but not
terrified.</p>

<p>"Are you really a spaceman?"
Robin asked.</p>

<p>Glaudot said: "Well, so one
of you can speak more than a
few grunts. That's something."
He looked carefully at
Robin. "Beautiful, too," he
said. The way he said it was
not a compliment. It was an
objective statement of fact.</p>

<p>"I know it won't help to
say I'm sorry about your
friend. Words won't help, I
guess. But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yeah," Glaudot said. "All
right. He's dead. I can't bring
him back and you can't bring
him back, sister."</p>

<p>"I'm not your sister,"
Robin said.</p>

<p>Glaudot told her it was a
way of speaking. He couldn't
quite believe his ears. She
spoke English as well as he
did, which was incredible
enough here on a world halfway
across the galaxy. But he
got the impression that she
was almost fantastically
naive. Yet the Indians&mdash;and,
incredibly, they were Indians&mdash;seemed
to be subservient to
her, almost seemed to worship
her.</p>

<p>Glaudot sat down on his
space helmet, which he had
taken off some minutes before,
and said: "Are you the
boss lady around here?"</p>

<p>"Boss lady? I don't understand."</p>

<p>"Are you in charge? Do you
run things?"</p>

<p>Robin smiled and said: "I
created them."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry. Now <i>I</i> don't get
<i>you</i>."</p>

<p>"I said I created them. It's
very simple. My friend and I
decided a very long time ago
it would be nice or interesting
or I forget what, it was so
long ago, if we had some Indians.
So, we created Indians."</p>

<p>Glaudot threw his head
back and laughed. "For a
minute," he said, "you almost
had me believing you." The
girl was dressed like a savage,
he told himself, like a
beautiful savage, but at least
she had a sense of humor.
That was something.</p>

<p>"But what is so funny?"
Robin asked.</p>

<p>"You just now said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know what I said. My
friend and I created the Indians.
Of course. Why? Can't
you create anything you
want? Just anything?"</p>

<p>"All right, sister," Glaudot
said a little angrily. He did
not like being made fun of,
for he lacked the capacity to
laugh at himself. "Just how
much of a fool do you think I
am?"</p>

<p>"Why, I don't know," Robin
replied. "How much of a fool
are you?"</p>

<p>Glaudot glared at her. Purcell
was going to be one mad
captain when he was told of
Chandler's death, but men
had died on expeditions before
and it really wasn't Glaudot's
fault. At any rate he
had established contact with
somebody of obvious importance
among the natives, and
Purcell would appreciate that.</p>

<p>"Never mind," Glaudot
said.</p>

<p>"Tell me about being a
spaceman. Do you really fly
among the stars?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes," Glaudot said,
"although it isn't really flying."</p>

<p>"And do you create new
stars as you go along?"</p>

<hr />

<p>There she went again with
her talk of creation, as if creating
things out of nothing
was the commonest occurrence
in the world. Glaudot
stood up. "All right, sister.
Show me."</p>

<p>"Why, show you what?"</p>

<p>"Create something."</p>

<p>"You mean," Robin said,
disappointed, "you actually
can't?"</p>

<p>"Just go ahead and create
something."</p>

<p>Robin shrugged. "What
would you like?"</p>

<p>Glaudot thought for a moment.
"A piano!" he said suddenly.
"How about a piano?"
It was complicated enough, he
thought. "And while you're at
it, how about telling me how
come everyone speaks English&mdash;or
tries to speak English
around here?"</p>

<p>Robin frowned. "Is there
some other way of speaking?"</p>

<p>Glaudot also frowned. That
line of thought wouldn't get
him anywhere. "O.K.," he
said. "One piano coming up?"</p>

<p>"All right," Robin said.</p>

<p>Glaudot blinked. The pretty
girl hadn't moved. She hadn't
even changed her facial expression.
But a parlor grand
piano stood on the rock before
them.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be damned,"
Glaudot said. "What else can
you create?"</p>

<p>"We made all the natives
here. We made the green and
crimson. We made this whole
Wild Country. We made
some of the animals too."</p>

<p>"Like&mdash;the piano? Out of
nothing?"</p>

<p>"Is there another way?"</p>

<p>Glaudot said, "You better
come back to the ship with
me. Captain'll like to see
you."</p>

<p>Tashtu shook his head.
"The Lady Robin awaits the
Lord."</p>

<p>Glaudot looked at Robin.
"Who's that?"</p>

<p>"Charlie. He's just my
friend. I&mdash;I don't think I have
to wait for him. I've always
been more interested in reading
about spacemen than he
has. I'll go with you now if
you want."</p>

<p>Tashtu looked unhappy.
"Lord Charlie, he say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, you wait right here,
Tashtu, and tell Charlie
where I've gone. What could
be simpler? I'll be all right,
don't worry about me."</p>

<p>"Lord Charlie, he say
watch you."</p>

<p>"And I say I'm going with
the spaceman to his spaceship."</p>

<p>Tashtu bowed. "The Lady
has spoken," he said, and
watched Robin descend the
rocky rampart and walk back
with Glaudot toward the far
distant glint of metal which
was this spaceship they were
talking about.</p>

<hr />

<p>"So you can create just
anything," Glaudot said.</p>

<p>"I guess so."</p>

<p>A goddess, he thought. A
beautiful goddess who ...</p>

<p>Suddenly he stared at her.
Who could make him the
most powerful man in the
galaxy.</p>

<p>"This spaceship of yours&mdash;"
she began.</p>

<p>"Wait. Wait a minute. If
you can create anything,
how's about re-creating Chandler?"</p>

<p>"Chand-ler? What is
Chand-ler?"</p>

<p>"The boy back there. The
one your braves killed."</p>

<p>Robin said: "If you wish,"
and Glaudot held his breath.
The power over life and
death, he thought....</p>

<p>He looked down and saw
Chandler's spacesuited body
there, the two arrows protruding
from his chest. He
shook his head. "Not dead,"
he said. "What good is he to
anybody dead?"</p>

<p>Robin nodded. "I'm sorry,"
she said. "I just hadn't
thought before of bringing
people back to life. It ... why
it seems ..."</p>

<p>"What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't really be
bringing him back, you
know. It would be a copy, just
a copy."</p>

<p>"But a perfect copy?"</p>

<p>"I think so."</p>

<p>"Then if it's just a copy it
shouldn't bother you at all,
should it?"</p>

<p>"Well ..." Robin said
doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Go ahead. Show me you
can do it."</p>

<p>Glaudot gaped. Another
figure sat alongside Chandler's
corpse, Chandler's second
corpse. The other figure
got up. It was Chandler.</p>

<hr />

<p>"Look out!" the new Chandler
cried. "Look out&mdash;Indians!"</p>

<p>"Just take it easy," Glaudot
told him. Glaudot's face
was very white, his eyes big
and round and staring.</p>

<p>Chandler looked down at
the body on the rocks. His
knees buckled and Glaudot
caught him, stopping him
from falling. Chandler tried
to say something, but the
words wouldn't come. He
stared with horrified fascination
at the body, which was
an exact copy of himself&mdash;or
a copy of the dead man
from whom the new living
man was copied.</p>

<p>"May we go to your spaceship
now?" Robin asked
Glaudot politely. "I have always
wished to see a spaceship."</p>

<p>Here was power, Glaudot
thought. Incredible power.
All the power to control
worlds, to carve worlds from
primordial slime, almost, for
yourself. Here was far more
power than any man in the
galaxy had ever been offered.
Was it his, Glaudot's?</p>

<p>It wouldn't be if he
brought the beautiful girl to
the spaceship and Purcell.
For Captain Purcell, a devoted
servant of the galactic
civilization which he was attempting
to spread to the
outworlds, would think in
terms of what good the discovery
of this girl could
bring to all humanity. But
if Glaudot kept her to himself ...</p>

<p>And then another thought
almost stunned him. Why
merely the girl? She'd mentioned
a friend, hadn't she?
Perhaps it was something in
the atmosphere of this
strange world, in the very air
you breathed. Perhaps anyone
could do it, could create
out of nothing&mdash;Glaudot included.</p>

<p>"You want to go to the
spaceship?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. Oh, yes."</p>

<p>"Then teach me the secret
of creation."</p>

<p>"Of making things, you
mean? Why, there isn't any
secret. Should there be any
secret? You merely&mdash;create."</p>

<p>"Show me," said Glaudot.</p>

<hr />

<p>A table appeared, and savory
dishes of food.</p>

<p>"Magician!" cried Chandler.</p>

<p>A great roan stallion,
bridled but without a saddle,
materialized. Robin swung
up on its broad back and
used her bare knees for balance
and control. The stallion
cantered off.</p>

<p>"Wait!" cried Glaudot.
"Please wait."</p>

<p>The stallion cantered back
and Robin alighted. The stallion
began to graze on a patch
of grass which suddenly appeared
on the naked rock.
The stallion seemed quite
content.</p>

<p>"You mean," the new
Chandler asked in an awed
voice, "she just <i>made</i> these
things? The food. The table.
The horse ..."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Glaudot. He
concentrated his will on creating
a single flower in the
new field of grass. He concentrated
his whole being.</p>

<p>But nothing happened.</p>

<p>He glared almost angrily
at Robin, as if it were her
fault. "I don't have the
power you have," he said.</p>

<p>She nodded. "Only Charlie
and me." She looked at the
roan stallion. "Beauty, isn't
he? I'll present him to Charlie."
She turned to Glaudot.
"Now take me to the ship."</p>

<p>"We ought to get started
back there, Mr. Glaudot,"
Chandler said.</p>

<p>"Yes? Why?"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but I don't have to
tell you why! This girl is one
of the most important discoveries
that has ever been
made. The ability to create
material things ... out of
nothing...."</p>

<p>"Show me your planet,"
Glaudot told Robin, ignoring
the younger man. "We can
talk about the spaceship
later. You see, I'm an explorer
and it's my job to
explore new worlds." He
spoke slowly, simply, as he
would speak to a child. Somehow,
although the girl was
not a child and was quite the
most astonishingly beautiful
girl he had ever seen, he
thought that was the right
approach.</p>

<p>"Now wait a minute, Mr.
Glaudot," Chandler protested.
"We both know it's our
duty to bring her to Captain
Purcell."</p>

<p>"Maybe you think it's your
duty," Glaudot told the
younger man. "I don't think
it's mine. And before you run
off to the ship to tell that
precious captain of yours,
you ought to know that you'd
be dead right now if it
hadn't been for me."</p>

<p>"You?"</p>

<p>"Hell, yes. Those Indians
or whatever they were killed
you. I asked the girl to bring
you back to life."</p>

<p>"To bring&mdash;" echoed Chandler
his mouth falling open.</p>

<p>"Actually, she produced a
perfect copy of you. A living
copy. Do you see what she
offers us, Chandler? Infinite
wealth from creativity out of
nothing&mdash;and eternal life by
copying our bodies each time
we die! What do you say
about your precious captain
now?"</p>

<p>Chandler seemed confused.
He shook his head, staring
first at Glaudot and then at
Robin. "The ship," he said.
"Our duty ... the captain ..."</p>

<p>Glaudot snorted and told
Robin: "Kill him."</p>

<p>"Kill him?"</p>

<p>"Yes. You brought him
into being. Now send him out
of being."</p>

<p>"But I can't do that. I have
no further control once I
make something. And besides
I&mdash;I wouldn't kill a human
being, even if I could."</p>

<p>Fear was in Chandler's
eyes. "Mr. Glaudot, listen ..."
he began.</p>

<p>"Listen, hell," Glaudot said.
"I brought you back to life. I
offered you a share in the
greatest power the worlds
have ever known. You turned
it down. I'm sorry, Chandler.
I'm really sorry for you. But
I can't let you return to the
ship, you see. Not until I
learn some more about this
world, not until I understand
exactly what the girl's power
is, and consolidate my position."</p>

<hr />

<p>Without waiting to hear
more, Chandler began to run.
In three great bounds he
reached the grazing roan
stallion and leaped on its
back, digging his heels into
its flanks. The stallion moved
off at a quick trot as Glaudot
drew his blaster and took
dead aim at Chandler's retreating back.</p>

<p>When he had Chandler
squarely in his sights, Glaudot
began to squeeze the trigger.
But suddenly the trigger-housing-unit
of the blaster
became encumbered with tiny
vines. There were hundreds
of them writhing and crawling
all over the weapon and
getting in the sights too so
Glaudot could no longer aim.
By the time he tore the vines
clear, cursing savagely, the
roan stallion had taken Chandler
out of sight on his retreat
toward the spaceship.</p>

<p>Glaudot whirled on Robin.
"You did this!" he accused
her. "You did it. Why&mdash;why?"</p>

<p>"You were going to kill
him. You shouldn't have."</p>

<p>"But now you've ruined
everything. Not just for me.
For us, don't you see? I could
have laid the world at your
feet. I could have&mdash;listen!
Tell me this&mdash;is there any
place we can hide? Some
place they won't find us if
they come looking, while we
work on this power of yours
and see exactly what it can
do and what it can't do?"</p>

<p>"I want to see the spaceship,
please," said Robin.</p>

<p>"Afterwards, I promise
you," Glaudot said. "Why, we
can make all the spaceships
we want&mdash;out of nothing.
Can't we?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Robin. "I guess
so. But even if we hide from
your friends, my friend
Charlie will find us. He'll be
worried about me and he'll
find us. Charlie can do everything
I can do, you see."</p>

<hr />

<p>Glaudot stared at her with
anger in his eyes. Then something
else replaced the anger.
No, he thought, Charlie
couldn't do everything she
could do. She was beautiful.
Her half-nude body summoned
desire in him. Tentatively,
ready to withdraw his
hand at the first indication
of protest, he touched her
bare shoulder. She made no
response. She merely stood
there, waiting for some kind
of an answer from him.</p>

<p>"Then we'll have to hide
from Charlie too. Please believe
me," Glaudot said. "I'm
a spaceman and you know
very little about spacemen.
Do you want to learn?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Yes, I do."</p>

<p>"Then take me some place
even Charlie will have difficulty
finding us."</p>

<p>"But he'll know."</p>

<p>"What do you mean he'll
know? Don't tell me you can
read one another's minds?"</p>

<p>"Oh, goodness, no. Nothing
like that. But when we were
very little I once told Charlie
if ever I got mad at him I
would go to hide in the country
of the Cyclopes and he
would never be able to find
me because the Cyclopes
would eat him. That was after
we read about the Cyclopes
in the Ulysses story in
our encyclopedia. You see?"</p>

<p>"Cyclopes, huh? You really
mean one-eyed giants?"</p>

<p>"Yes. We made them but
they don't obey us."</p>

<p>"Can the two of us hide in
their land? Is it far?"</p>

<p>"No. Very close. But I
don't know if I want&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm a spaceman, aren't I?
And you want to learn all
about spacemen and the
worlds beyond this place,
don't you? Then come with
me!"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you say no and I go
back to the spaceship we'll
blast off and you'll never see
spacemen again the rest of
your life," threatened Glaudot.</p>

<p>Robin did not answer.
"Well?" Glaudot snapped, as
if he was quite indifferent.
"Would you want that to
happen?"</p>

<p>"No," Robin admitted after
a while.</p>

<p>"Then let's go." They had
to hurry, Glaudot knew. Riding
that stallion, that incredible
conjured-out-of-nothing
stallion, Chandler had probably
reached the spaceship by
now. A few words, a few hurried
explanations, and Purcell
would lead an armed party
out after Glaudot.</p>

<p>Again Robin was silent.
Glaudot stood stiffly in front
of her, so close he could reach
out and wrap his arms about
her. But this wasn't the time,
he told himself. Later ...
later ...</p>

<p>"All right," Robin said at
last, her eyes looking troubled.
"I'll take you to the land
of Cyclopes."</p>

<p>They began to walk, in silence.
Half an hour later, the
barren terrain of rocks gave
way to a verdant jungle in
which the trees were quite
the biggest Glaudot had ever
seen and in which even the
grass and the fragrant wild
flowers grew over their
heads. Glaudot had never felt
so small.</p>

<hr />

<p>"Wait a minute, Chandler,"
Captain Purcell said.
"I listened in silence to what
you said. All of it, as incredible
as it sounded. But you
don't expect me to believe&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Look at the horse. Where
did I get the horse, sir?"</p>

<p>"So there are horses on
this world. So what?"</p>

<p>"But I saw the girl create
it out of thin air!"</p>

<p>"Really, Chandler."</p>

<p>"And I saw the corpse. My
corpse, Captain. Mine!"</p>

<p>"But hell, man. Glaudot
would have come back here
with the girl. He knows his
obligation to civilization.
He&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Glaudot, sir? Does he?"</p>

<p>Purcell scowled and said
finally: "Chandler, either you
and Glaudot have made the
most astonishing discovery
since man first domesticated
his environment and so became
more than a reasonably
clever animal, or you're the
biggest liar that ever crossed
deep space."</p>

<p>Chandler offered his captain
a pale smile. "Why don't
you find out which, sir?"</p>

<p>"By God," said Purcell, "I
will. McCreedy!" he bawled
over the intercom. "Smith!
Wong! I want an armed expedition
of twenty-five men
ready to leave the ship in
half an hour."</p>

<p>And, exactly half an hour
later, the expedition set out
with Captain Purcell and
Chandler leading it. Chandler
went astride the roan
stallion.</p>

<hr />

<p>When Charlie and his small
Indian band learned that the
action had taken place to the
south, where Robin had gone,
they set out quickly in that
direction. The further they
went, the more worried
Charlie became. If Robin had
met with any kind of success,
if she had called off the war
party and established some
kind of peaceful relations
with the spacemen, a runner
would have been sent to
tell them. But the desolate
rock-strewn terrain stretched
out before them as devoid of
life as the Paleozoic Earth.</p>

<p>Charlie urged his men on
relentlessly. He was a tireless
hiker and since the braves
lived by hunting they could
match almost any pace he
set. Finally Charlie saw the
second Indian band ahead of
them. Slinging the Mannlicher
Elephant Gun, he began
to run.</p>

<p>"Tashtu!" he called. "Tashtu!"</p>

<p>The Indian sprinted to him.
"Lord," he said breathlessly,
"one sky critter, him die.
Turn out man."</p>

<p>"What are you talking
about?" Charlie asked.</p>

<p>Tashtu led him to the
group of braves which still
clustered about Ensign
Chandler's body. "Why?"
Charlie demanded, horror-struck.
"Why?"</p>

<p>Tashtu told him all that
had happened. How the
braves had mistaken the
spacesuited man for a monster.
How arrows had been
fired before they had learned
otherwise. How Robin had
come, and gone off with the
spaceman.</p>

<p>"To their spaceship?"
Charlie asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, Lord. That is what
they spoke of." Tashtu pointed
to the top of the rampart
of rock. "From there, Lord,
you can see it."</p>

<p>Charlie scrambled up the
rock. From his giddy perch
on top he could see the tiny
silver gleam of the spaceship&mdash;and
a band of men, led by
a man on horseback, approaching
them. Charlie hurried
down the rock, half
climbing, half sliding. "They
are coming," he said. "Maybe
Robin's with them." He
remembered what had happened
last time and said:
"The rest of you return to
your homes. Tashtu and I
will go on ahead."</p>

<p>"But Lord&mdash;" Tashtu began.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"I did not like the man. I
did not trust him."</p>

<p>"Then why did you let
Robin go?"</p>

<p>"Let her, Lord? But surely
Robin, the Lady Robin, does
not obey a mere&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All right, all right," Charlie
said. "But all the more
reason for the rest of the
braves to return to their
homes. We can handle this,
Tashtu, you and I. I don't
want any more killing."</p>

<p>"Yes, Lord," said Tashtu.</p>

<p>The Indians formed a
marching column and moved
off. Charlie told Tashtu what
he had seen from the top of
the rampart. Then he added:
"Let's go and meet them."</p>

<p>And Charlie and Tashtu
set out across the tortuous
Wild Country.</p>

<hr />

<p>"Two men coming!" Chandler
cried, reining up the
roan stallion.</p>

<p>Captain Purcell signaled
his twenty-five men to halt,
and their orderly double file
came up short behind him.
Pretty soon the two figures
could be seen by all, advancing
toward them across the
rocks. When they were close
enough, Captain Purcell
hailed: "We come in peace!"</p>

<p>"And in peace we come!"
Charlie called. A moment
later he was shaking hands
gravely with Captain Purcell.</p>

<p>"Tell the captain about&mdash;about
my corpse," Chandler
told Tashtu.</p>

<p>Charlie looked at Chandler.
He had seen the dead man.
"Did Robin make you?" he
asked in surprise. "We never
brought the dead to life before."</p>

<p>"Can you really do it?"
Purcell demanded.</p>

<p>"No, not really. But we
can copy perfectly&mdash;and the
copies live."</p>

<p>"You see?" Chandler demanded
triumphantly.</p>

<p>Captain Purcell said:
"Show me."</p>

<hr />

<p>Charlie created a brother
to the roan stallion. Captain
Purcell gawked. The one example
sufficed and he did not
ask for more as Glaudot had
done.</p>

<p>"Where's Robin?" Charlie
asked. "At the ship?"</p>

<p>Chandler shook his head.
"Glaudot went off with her."</p>

<p>"But I thought he was on
the ship!"</p>

<p>"He deserted," Chandler
said. "With the girl. He
wants her. He wants her
power for himself."</p>

<p>Charlie moved very quickly.
He swung in front of
Chandler and grabbed his
tunic-front, bunching it, ripping
it and all but dragging
Chandler clear off his feet before
a hand could be raised
to stop him. "Where did they
go?" he asked in a terrible
voice. "Where are they? Take
me to them."</p>

<p>"But I don't&mdash;don't know!"
Chandler protested, trying
without success to break
free.</p>

<p>It was Captain Purcell
who came forward and firmly
took Charlie's arm, pulling
him clear of Chandler. "Remember,"
he said. "In peace.
In peace."</p>

<p>Charlie stood with his
hands at his sides. His face
was white and strained. "The
girl," he said.</p>

<p>"We all want to find out
where Glaudot took her,"
Captain Purcell said. "We're
going to help you. Tell me:
could the girl have gone
willingly with Glaudot? To
share his mad dream of
power, perhaps?"</p>

<p>"Robin?" Charlie cried.
"Never!"</p>

<p>"Please, lad," Captain Purcell
said. "I want you to
think. I want you to consider
everything. You and this girl
of yours may have almost
godlike powers, but you've
spent your lives on an uncivilized
world and well&mdash;frankly&mdash;couldn't
a sophisticated
man like Glaudot turn
the girl's head? Couldn't he
confuse her into going off
with him, at least temporarily?
And, assuming, he did,
he doesn't know this world.
He's aware of that. He'd
know we'd be coming after
him. Perhaps the girl would
tell him about you. Tell me,
man&mdash;where would the girl
go if she didn't want you to
find her? Is there such a
place? Before you answer, I
want you to know that what
we do here may be far graver
than you think. It is not
merely the safety of one girl
we have to consider&mdash;but no,
you wouldn't understand ..."</p>

<p>"You mean," Charlie asked,
"if this man Glaudot
somehow convinces Robin to
use her power as he tells her,
he might want to take over
all of Crimson?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean this world?
Is it called Crimson? Yes&mdash;and
more than that. There's
no telling how far a man like
Glaudot could go with such
power. And with the ability
to create all the armament
and all the deadly weapons
he needed, and all the missiles
to carry those weapons, he
might challenge the entire
galaxy&mdash;and win!"</p>

<p>The words were strange to
Charlie. He only understood
them vaguely. Now Robin,
she would understand, he
thought. Robin was always
more interested in things like
that, Robin who almost knew
their encyclopedia by heart,
Robin ...</p>

<p>"Listen," he said. "Listen.
We created all the life on
this world. We made Greeks
and Royal Navymen and Ministers
and Russians and Congressmen
and everything we
knew or somehow had heard
about or had read in our
book. We get along fine with
all of them, except ..."</p>

<p>"Yes," Captain Purcell
prompted. "Go on, go on!"</p>

<p>"No, she'd never go there.
She was always afraid of
them."</p>

<p>"Where, man? Where?"</p>

<p>"No. Robin wouldn't. She
just wouldn't."</p>

<p>It was not hot in Wild
Country, but sweat trickled
down Purcell's face while he
waited for Charlie's answer.</p>

<hr />

<p>"Show me!" cried Glaudot
in rapture. "Show me! Show
me! Show me!"</p>

<p>He stood with Robin in a
little glade in the Land of the
Cyclopes. About them were
heaped all the treasures Glaudot
had suddenly demanded.
He did not quite know why.
He felt his iron control slipping
and permitted it to slip
now, for once he got this wild
desire from his system, he
knew only his untroubled
iron will would be left, and
with it&mdash;and the girl&mdash;he
might conquer the galaxy.</p>

<p>Heaped about them were
jewels and precious metals
and deadly weapons, all of
which Robin had summoned
into being at Glaudot's orders,
while Glaudot smiled at
her. It was almost a frightening
smile. She was even a
little sorry she had come
away with him, but she could
always go back, couldn't she?
She wasn't shackled to this
strange man from space, was
she? And the way he looked
at her, the desire she saw in
his eyes, that was frightening
too. She did not know
how to cope with it. Oh, she
could create a duplicate
Charlie, for example. Charlie
would know what to do.
Charlie would help her. Charlie
hadn't read the book as
she had read it, but Charlie
was more practical. Still,
what would they do with the
duplicate Charlie afterwards?
You couldn't uncreate
something ...</p>

<p>"A spaceship," Glaudot
said suddenly. "Can you
create a spaceship out of
nothing?"</p>

<hr />

<p>Robin nodded slowly. "I
can. Yes, I can. It tells all
about spaceships in the book.
But I don't know if I want
to."</p>

<p>Glaudot let it pass. There
was no hurry. He was thinking
about the future, though.
If Purcell opposed him, as
Purcell would, and managed
to escape in the exploration
ship, Glaudot would need a
ship to leave this world ...</p>

<p>"Why not?" he asked, his
voice quite calm now, the
mania which had seized him
under control now, and only
his iron purpose motivating
him.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know. You
have one spaceship. I guess
that's why. What do you need
another one for?"</p>

<p>"It was just a thought,"
said Glaudot. "It doesn't
matter." He kneeled near the
heaps of sun-dazzled jewels.
He let them trickle through
his fingers. No, the desire
wasn't gone yet. It was still
fighting with his will. And,
since he knew his will could
win at any time, it pleased
him to give his desire free
rein.</p>

<p>He scooped up a handful
of jewels. He found a necklace
and came close to Robin
and dropped it over her head.
The pearls were very white
against her sun-tanned skin.
The pearl pendant hung almost
to the start of the dusky
valley which cleaved her
breasts delightfully and disappeared
with the tanned
swell of flesh on either side
into the gold-mesh halter.
Glaudot fingered the pendant.
His fingers touched flesh.
Abruptly he drew the surprised
Robin to him and
kissed her lips hungrily.</p>

<p>For a moment she remained
passive. She neither returned
his ardor nor fought
it. But when his hands began
to stroke her back she pulled
away from him and stood
there looking at him. She
took the necklace off and
threw it at his feet.</p>

<p>"I don't want that any
more," she said. "Why did
you do&mdash;what you did?"</p>

<hr />

<p>He felt the fire in his veins.
He willed it to subside. He
needed his control now. All
of it. But this girl, in the full
flower of her youth ... No,
she was not a girl, not to
Glaudot. He must not think
of her as a girl. She was
power. Power. The power
was his&mdash;if he didn't alienate
the girl.</p>

<p>"We do such as that on my
world," he said. "It is a kind
of homage to loveliness. I
hope you didn't mind."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;it was strange. With
Charlie sometimes I hope&mdash;but
with Charlie it is ... different.
Please don't touch me
again. Please promise me
that."</p>

<p>Glaudot shrugged. "If you
wish, my dear child, if you
wish...."</p>

<p>The dual desire was gone
now, truly gone. He knew
that. For his will had been
threatened, more by his own
foolish desire than by this
innocent girl. He had to
think. Clearly. More clearly
than he had ever thought before.
He needed the girl as
an ally. Not as a slave. She
had to be willing. She had to
co-operate. Give her a warped
picture of the rest of the
galaxy? Convince her its governments
were evil, totalitarian,
when in reality they were
democratic? Convince her
that he alone, given unlimited
power, could right the
wrongs of a thousand worlds?
She was naive enough for
that sort of approach, he
thought. Besides, it would
strike her as something like
creation&mdash;moral creation,
perhaps. And creation she
would understand. Then, with
her as his partner, he could
quickly build a war machine
which the combined might of
the galaxy couldn't stand
against. And that, he suddenly
realized, would even include
an unlimited number
of soldiers for occupation
and policing duties. This
power would be unparalleled.</p>

<p>"I have something I want
to tell you about," he said.
"It will take a long time and
we must be undisturbed,
which is why I asked you to
bring me here."</p>

<p>"What is it you want to tell
me?"</p>

<p>Before Glaudot could answer,
they heard a crashing,
rending sound not too far off
in the woods. It sounded to
Glaudot exactly as if trees
were being uprooted, boulders
strewn carelessly.</p>

<p>"Cyclopes!" Robin screamed
in terror, and began to
run.</p>

<p>Glaudot ran after her,
stumbling, picking himself
up, hurtling in pursuit. He
couldn't let her get away. He
had to follow her ...</p>

<p>Nothing living, he told
himself as he ran, could uproot
those huge trees. Of
course, there were the saplings,
but even the saplings
were the size of full-grown
oaks and maples on far
Earth.</p>

<p>Something roared behind
him. The sound was pitched
almost too low for human
ears. He whirled. The earth
shook, great clods of it flying.
Bare tree roots suddenly
appeared, and a young tree
the size of a towering oak
was lifted skyward.</p>

<p>Behind it, brandishing it
and then hurling it away, was
a naked man whose head
towered impossibly a hundred
and fifty feet into the air.
Trembling, awestruck, Glaudot
looked up at the great
savage face. Wild hair
streaming, filthy beard matted
with dirt and tree-branches,
it was the most
ferocious face Glaudot had
ever seen.</p>

<p>And it had only one eye,
one enormous eye in the middle
of its head. But an eye
three feet across!</p>

<p>"A Cyclops!" Robin
screamed again.</p>

<p>A moment later the creature
stooped and with a
scooping motion of its great
right hand picked up the two
tiny creatures on the forest
floor beneath it. Then it ran,
uprooting oak-sized saplings,
back toward the rocky hillside
where it dwelled, after
the Cyclopes of old on which
Robin and Charlie had naively
patterned it, in a cave
overlooking the sea.</p>

<hr />

<p>"Where, man? Where?"
Captain Purcell demanded.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Charlie
said. "I really don't think
she would. You see, she always
threatened she'd go
there if we ever had a fight,
but she was usually half-joking.
She knows it's dangerous&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But where? Don't you
know a drowning man has
to grasp at straws? Haven't
I gotten it across to you&mdash;the
whole galaxy may be in
danger!"</p>

<p>Charlie sighed. "I don't
understand much of your galaxy.
Robin knows the
encyclopedia&mdash;she would
understand. And I&mdash;I only
want to know Robin is safe."
He took a deep breath and
said: "She always threatened
to go to the Land of the Cyclopes."</p>

<p>"Then take us there
at once," Captain Purcell
said....</p>

<hr />

<p>If he shouted and cried
now, he would go insane. He
knew that. He tried to hold
his fear in check. He was being
swung pendulum-like in
an enormous hand as the one-eyed
giant loped along. Robin
shared the clenched-fist prison
with him. Her hair
streamed in the wind as the
huge arm swung the huge
hand in time with the giant's
enormous strides.</p>

<p>"Does it eat people?" he
managed to ask Robin. He
had to shout because the
wind created by the creature's
movement was considerable.
The ground spun giddily
far, far below them,
whirling patches of green, of
yellow, of brown.</p>

<p>"We made them to eat people.
Like in the book. We
were just children. It seemed&mdash;it
seemed so thrilling."</p>

<p>The Cyclops loped along,
uprooting saplings. After a
while it began to climb a
rocky slope and from the
heights Glaudot could see the
shores of an unknown sea.
Then the Cyclops reached a
cave entrance and rolled
aside a huge boulder and took
his prisoners within.</p>

<p>Glaudot heard the bleating
of sheep.</p>

<hr />

<p>"Why, it's a fortune in
jewels!" Captain Purcell exclaimed.
They had found the
glade in the forest, where
Robin had created a king's
ransom for Glaudot. The men
gathered around, many of
them struck dumb by the
sight of all this wealth.</p>

<p>Charlie said: "Captain,
look."</p>

<p>Purcell went over to him
and saw the wide swathe cut
through the forest and curving
out of sight. "What went
through there?" he gasped.</p>

<p>"A Cyclops," Charlie said
grimly. "A Cyclops has
them. Captain, we've got to
hurry. Listen, there are two
horses now. I could create
horses for all of us, but all
these men coming up would
probably be seen by the Cyclops.
You come on foot with
your men. Let one of them
come with me on the stallions."
As he spoke Charlie
unslung the Mannlicher and
put it down.</p>

<p>"Oh, you want our more
modern weapons?" Purcell
asked.</p>

<p>Charlie shook his head.
"For fun, Robin and I made
the Cyclopes invulnerable to
any kind of attack except the
kind mentioned in the encyclopedia&mdash;putting
out their
single eye with a stake. To
protect all the other people
we created, we made the Cyclopes
so they'd never want
to leave their homeland. So
if we can get Robin and your
man Glaudot free, they'll be
safe. Now, who's the volunteer?"</p>

<p>"I'm already on horseback,"
Chandler said. Charlie
nodded and mounted the second
roan stallion.</p>

<p>"My men will be coming as
fast as they can march," Captain
Purcell said.</p>

<p>Charlie nodded. He did not
bother to tell the captain that
a Cyclops could cover in a
few minutes ground a marching
party could not hope to
cover in as many hours. He
set off at a swift gallop with
Chandler.</p>

<hr />

<p>"Will he eat us now?" said
Glaudot. Strangely, he was
not afraid. The unexpected
nature of their impending
demise he almost found
amusing.</p>

<p>Robin shook her head. "I
don't think so. He'll probably
drink himself to sleep. We
made the Cyclopes great
drunkards."</p>

<p>The Cyclops, his tree-trunk
sized walking stick leaning
against the wall, was reclining
and drinking from a huge
bowl of wine. The cave was
torchlit. Seventy or eighty
sheep milled about, settling
for the night after three of
their number had supplied a
meal for the giant, who had
eaten them raw.</p>

<p>"Isn't there anything we
can do?" demanded Glaudot,
whose dreams of galactic conquest
were fading before the
spectre of being eaten alive.</p>

<p>"Reserve your strength
until he sleeps," Robin said.
"Of course there's something
we can do."</p>

<p>"Yes? What?"</p>

<p>"His walking stick. You
see the end comes almost to
a point? We harden it in the
fire&mdash;and put his eye out.
Then, in the morning, when
he unrolls the stone from the
cave-entrance and blindly
leads his flock out, we hide
among the sheep and make
our escape. At least that's
how it happens in the encyclopedia."</p>

<p>Glaudot swallowed hard.
He had never had a great deal
of physical courage....</p>

<p>Just then they heard a
great fluttering, groaning
sound. Robin said: "You see,
he's asleep. He's snoring."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't think I could
possibly&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He's liable to want us for
breakfast. Come on."</p>

<p>They got up swiftly and
silently, and crept to the
walking stick. It was the size
of a young tree. It would be
heavy, perhaps too heavy for
them to handle.</p>

<p>"Easy now," Robin said.
She nimbly climbed the
ledges on the cave-wall and
tipped the great walking
stick, then leaped down and
grabbed the front end as
Glaudot got a grip on the
rear of the big pole.</p>

<p>"Heavy," Glaudot said.</p>

<p>"But not too heavy, I&mdash;I
think."</p>

<p>"Try to lift it," said Glaudot.</p>

<p>They tried. Together they
could barely get it overhead.</p>

<p>"Try to poke it at something,"
Glaudot said.</p>

<p>They could not. Robin
sighed. They put it down
slowly, quietly. It would take
more than the two of them.
It would take them and two
or three more men to do the
job.</p>

<p>"We wait," Glaudot said
bleakly.</p>

<p>Robin stared up in frustration
at the smoke hole,
through which smoke from
the Cyclops's fire poured out
into the gathering night. It
was hopelessly over their
head, although help could
reach them through it from
the outside. But how could
they possibly expect help to
come...?</p>

<p>"We wait," Glaudot said
again, hopelessly.</p>

<p>"For breakfast," Robin
said.</p>

<p>Glaudot broke suddenly. "I
don't want to die!" he cried.
"I don't want to die ..."</p>

<hr />

<p>The feeblest of Crimson's
three suns came over the
horizon, lighting the landscape
with the illumination
of three or four full moons on
Earth.</p>

<p>"I told you I smelled
smoke!" Charlie cried, pointing
triumphantly at the thin
tendril of smoke that rose
through the cooling air
against the weak sunlight.</p>

<p>"Is it a campfire?" Chandler
asked.</p>

<p>"Chimney hole, probably.
Come on."</p>

<p>They left the two stallions
grazing at the base of the
rocky escarpment. They began
to climb. Once Chandler
stumbled and went sliding
down the rocky slope, but
Charlie caught his arm, all
but wrenching it from the
socket. Charlie thought: we
have to hurry. Their lives
may depend on it. Already
we may be too late....</p>

<p>The smoke from the chimney
hole was acrid. It was
very strong now. Suddenly
Charlie could feel the slightly
increased slope of the rocks.
The slope was precipitous
now, almost perpendicular.</p>

<p>"I can't&mdash;can't go much
further!" Chandler groaned.</p>

<p>"We've got to, man. We've
got to."</p>

<hr />

<p>"He's waking," said Robin.</p>

<p>Glaudot had broken completely.
The confident would-be
conqueror was reduced to
trembling and whining now.
"M-maybe he's hungry. Oh,
God, maybe he's hungry ..."</p>

<p>But the Cyclops only
turned over in its sleep and
began to snore again. The
fire had burned low. The
sheep were resting. Robin
thought of Charlie, probably
many miles away. There
would be a late moonrise tonight,
she thought. They
often spoke of the feeblest of
Crimson's three suns as the
moon, although it really
wasn't. Then dawn would
come. If the Cyclops were
hungry and wanted a change
in diet ...</p>

<hr />

<p>"But you'll choke to death
going down there," Chandler
protested.</p>

<p>"It's only a chimney hole.
Nobody's going to choke to
death."</p>

<p>"Can you see down it?"</p>

<p>"No. Too much smoke."</p>

<p>"Then how do you know
how far we'll have to fall?"</p>

<p>"I don't. I'll have to take
the chance. You don't have
to, though."</p>

<p>"I'll go where you go.
That's what I volunteered
for."</p>

<p>"Good. It's almost morning,
so the fire's probably almost
burned down from now.
If you land in the embers,
jump aside quickly. You understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Chandler said.</p>

<p>Without another word,
Charlie suddenly lowered
himself into the smoke and
let go.</p>

<hr />

<p>Dim fiery light lit the cave.
He alighted in embers and
quickly jumped clear. Embers
flew. A ram bleated. Charlie
saw the enormous sleeping
bulk of the Cyclops against
one wall of the cave. He
heard something behind him,
and whirled. It was Chandler.
More sparks flew. The
sheep bleated again, louder
this time.</p>

<p>Robin and a spaceman who
was probably Glaudot came
toward them. There was
amazement on Robin's face.
Glaudot looked like a child in
the grip of terror he couldn't
quite understand.</p>

<p>Charlie held Robin close
for a moment. "Quiet," he
whispered. "Listen."</p>

<p>The slight disturbance had
bothered the Cyclops. He was
half awake. He made noises
with his lips. One great arm
lifted and fell. It could have
crushed the four of them.</p>

<p>"There's a stake," Robin
said. "Just like in the book."</p>

<p>They got it and took it to
the embers of the fire between
them. Glaudot, who brought
up the rear, dragged his end,
the wood scraping on the
rocky floor.</p>

<p>"Lift it up," Charlie said.</p>

<p>Glaudot giggled and then
began to cry. He was hysterical.
"The three of us?"
Charlie asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Robin
said.</p>

<p>Glaudot laughed hysterically.
The Cyclops stirred.
That made up Charlie's mind.
He placed his end of the stake
carefully on the floor and
went back to Glaudot. He
struck Glaudot neatly and
precisely on the point of the
jaw and Glaudot collapsed in
his arms.</p>

<p>Then they returned with
the stake to the fire. Charlie
scraped and pushed the embers
together with a charcoal
log. They began to toast the
point of the stake.</p>

<p>"We've got to hurry,"
Robin said.</p>

<p>"The skin of his eyelid is
like armor plate," Charlie
told her. "We've got to make
sure it doesn't turn the point
aside."</p>

<p>The flock stirred and began
to grow more lively. It
was now dawn outside. The
Cyclops yawned in his sleep
and stretched out an arm the
size of an oak tree.</p>

<p>"Hurry!" Robin said urgently.</p>

<p>The Cyclops rolled over, its
face to the wall.</p>

<p>"The eye!" Charlie groaned.
"We'll never be able to
reach the eye now."</p>

<p>They kept at their work,
though. There was nothing
else they could do. The surface
wood of the big stake
was taking on a dull cherry-red
color. Finally Charlie
said: "That's enough, I
guess."</p>

<p>The Cyclops rolled over
again. They were in luck,
Charlie thought, but changed
his mind immediately. The
Cyclops sat up, its eye blinking
sleepily. It yawned and
stretched mightily, then
stared stupidly for a few moments
at the flock of sheep.
Charlie and the others stood
frozen, not daring to move.
The Cyclops brushed at the
sheep with its hand, and two
of them crashed with bone-crushing
thuds and death-rattle
bleats against the wall.
The Cyclops glared stupidly
about, its one great eye
squinting. Clearly, it was
looking for something else to
eat. Not sheep. People ...</p>

<p>It got down on hands and
knees and groped on the floor.
The arm swept out. The
hand flashed ponderously by,
missing Robin by only a few
feet. The Cyclops advanced
on its knees, searching, its
mouth slavering now. It was
hungry and soon it would
eat ...</p>

<p>The hand swept by again,
caught a sheep. The hand
lifted, the sheep bleated, the
jaws crunched once and the
sheep disappeared. The Cyclops
wiped a trace of blood
from its lips. The hand came
down again, closer ...</p>

<hr />

<p>"The stake!" Charlie whispered
fiercely.</p>

<p>They brought it up horizontally.
Charlie stood just
behind the point, Robin behind
him, Chandler in the
rear. They jabbed with the
stake as the Cyclops's hand
swept along the floor again.
The Cyclops roared with
pain and rage and beat both
mighty hands on the rocky
floor, attempting to crush its
tormentors.</p>

<p>Just then Glaudot regained
consciousness and stood up
groggily. "Don't move!"
Charlie warned, taking the
chance of revealing their own
position in an attempt to save
Glaudot's life.</p>

<p>But Glaudot, seeing the
huge creature so close, began
to run. It was like running
on a treadmill. He ran and
he ran and after a while the
Cyclops reached down and
plucked him off the floor. He
screamed thinly. There was
the same crunching as before&mdash;and
no Glaudot ...</p>

<p>Now the Cyclops, its appetite
whetted, searched the
floor in a frenzy of earnest
on hands and knees. The
great head swung low, close
to the floor, the single eye
stared myopically. Once the
huge hand clubbed the rock
so close to them that Charlie
could feel the floor shaking.
They retreated slowly toward
the far wall of the cave, the
monster following relentlessly.
They still held the heavy
stake between them but had
not yet gathered either the
strength or the courage for
their one try. If they failed&mdash;</p>

<p>They had backed up as far
as they could. The wall was
behind them. The monster
came on, its head low, its
nose practically scraping the
ground. It swept the floor
with a giant hand, a fingertip
barely touching Charlie
and almost knocking him
senseless. He shook his head
and took deep breaths until
his strength returned.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, as the
hand began its swinging arc
again.</p>

<hr />

<p>They ran forward toward
the creature's single eye with
the stake.</p>

<p>Charlie barely remembered
the contact, or the bath of
eye-fluid and blood which
followed, or the wild roaring
of the brute creature, or its
frantic charging back and
forth, blinded, across the
cave, while the flock bleated
and stampeded. After a while
the crazed Cyclops ran to the
cave entrance and shouldered
the great door-rock aside,
rushing out into the day.</p>

<p>It went tearing down the
slope and did not stop until,
battered and bleeding, it
reached the sea. It stood on
the narrow strand of beach
for a moment, scooping great
handfuls of water for its
stricken eye. Then it plunged
into the surf.</p>

<p>They went outside and
watched it. They made their
way down the slope while it
advanced into the sea. Finally
only the great head remained
above the waves.</p>

<p>They reached the shore.</p>

<p>The Cyclops was gone.</p>

<p>Moments later, Captain
Purcell and the others joined
them.</p>

<hr />

<p>"Then you mean you won't
come back to Earth with us?"
Purcell asked later, in the
spaceship.</p>

<p>"Not if all you say about
this world is true," Charlie
said. "We're needed here."</p>

<p>"Yes," Purcell agreed.
"With your help, the galaxy
could be made into a universe
of plenty for everyone."</p>

<p>"Besides," said Robin.
"We'll have to think of training
children to take over
after we're gone." She looked
at Charlie. She blushed.
"Such as our own," she said,
very quickly, and added:
"You can marry us, can't you,
Captain?"</p>

<p>Purcell beamed, and nodded,
and did so.</p>

<p>Later, Charlie said: "It
isn't only that we're needed
here, is it, darling?"</p>

<p>Robin shook her head. "We
like it here," she said.</p>
